# CSC111-BasicCalculator-

# Assignment 01 

A "Readme" file is usually a file that accompanies source code or installation scripts to give a user some context or additional instructions.

In this case, all the relevant info is in the comments of `main.py`.

They are repeated here for your convenience:

```python
# INSTRUCTIONS (you may delete these comments if you like)
# In this assignment, you will write a short python program 
# that simulates basic calculator functionality. 

# The user interface of your calculator should ask the user 
# to input two numbers, and then a string indicating which 
# mathematical operation to perform. For example:

#    Enter the first number: 5
#    Enter the second number: 10
#    Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, or **): *
#    The answer is: 50

# Your calculator should support add, subtract, multiply, 
# divide and power (exponentiation) operations. If you choose, 
# you may also support integer division with a remainder.

# Your calculator should be able to handle both integers 
# and floats.
```

Note that you are asked to change the info in the "header":
```python
#        Name: <YOUR NAME HERE>
# Course Info: CSC111 - Fall 2021
# Description: Submission for Assignment 1
#        Date: <TODAY'S DATE HERE>
```

Remember that if you collaborated with someone, you should write both names in the header.

In addition, remember to add a block comment - at the very end -  indicating any references you checked when working on this assignment. The following is an example:

```python
# REFERENCES
# I googled "how to format output in python" and used
# <blah 01>.com.
# Also, I googled "how to use eval in python" and used
# <blah 02>.com.
# etc
```
